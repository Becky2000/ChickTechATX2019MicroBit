# Digital watch
[Home](./)

## Time to plan our design
Pseudode
1. Create variables for time (empty string), hours (0), minutes (0), ampm (String "AM")
2. Set Hour: When A button is pressed, if hour variable is less than 23, add one to hour, else set hour to 1. 
   1. Display Hour. 
   2. Clear Screen.
3. Set Minutes: When B button is pressed, if minute variable is less than 23, add one to minute, else set minute to zero. 
   1. Display Minutes. 
   2. Clear Screen.
4. Set AM/PM: When A + B buttons pressed, change from am to pm or vice versa. 
   1. Display "AM" or "PM". 
   2. Clear Screen.
5. Keep time: 
   1. Pause 60 seconds (6000 ms). 
   2. If minutes variable is less than 60, add one to minutes, else set minutes to zero. 
   3. If hours variable is less than 12, add one to hours, else set hours to zero.
6. Display time: On shake, display time variable as hh:mm am/pm. Then clear the screen.


## Make the  variables
We need to make some variables to keep track of the time and for a few other things.
1. Go into **Basic** in the toolbox and pull an **basic:on start** on to the workspace.
2. Ok, in **Variables** click on `Make a Variable`. Name the variable as `hours`. Drag out a **variables:set to** block and change the name with the dropdown to `hours`. Place the variable into the **basic:on start** block.
3. Repeat this 4 more times to make variables named `minutes`, `time`, , and `ampm`.
4. Now, for the **variables:set to** block for `time`, go to **Text** and drag a `" "` in and replace the `0`.
5. For the `ampm` variable, go to **Text** and drag a `" "` and replace the `0`. Change the ` `  to a `AM` .

## Enhancements

Think about how you can enchance your watch application. 
Can you change the code to make it simpler? 
Can you switch to military time (24 hour format where 13:00 = 1:00 PM)? 
Are there any features you would like to add?
